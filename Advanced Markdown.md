# Advanced Markdown

This section will cover some of the more complex features of markdown. These are functions that are less commonly used, but are valuable to know, as when the situation arises, they are quite useful. Some of these functionalities are coded in ways similar to HTML, which markdown has (limited) support for.

Collapsible sections of text are useful for reducing clutter in a page when dealing with large amounts of text. A collapsible section begins and ends with the 'details' header. The summary denotes what the section will display when collapsed, while the section following that is what is contained inside. 

```
<details>
<summary>"Collapsible Section"</summary>
You can write whatever you want here. It will appear as normal when the section is opened.
However, no other markdown formatting works here. Only plain text will appear here, everything else
will have had its formatting removed.
</details>
