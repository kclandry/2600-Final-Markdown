# Embedding and Formatting

This page will demonstrate more advanced uses of markdown. Namely, embedding images, using links, creating tables and more.

First of all, on the previous page, there were several horizontal lines used to seperate the individual sections. These were created using groupings of certain symbols. A group of three or more asterisks, dashes(hyphens) , or underscores may be used.

```To demonstrate:
---
*****
___________
```
These become the following lines:

---
*****
___________

In the same vein, throughout this tutorial, I have been demonstrating the use of markdown in plain text, then showing the result of using the text in markdown. This is achieved by framing the section with three tick marks ( \`\ ) This creates a section of code. While this is meant to be used for showing the raw code of programming languages, it works just as well for this tutorial.

***When framed with three tick marks, this sentence will be displayed in plain text.***

One of the most important tools in markdown is the ability to embed links. This functionality has been used to create the links that have jumped you to and from the Table of Contents. Creating links in markdown is, unsurprisingly, simple.

To create a link, frame the word, phrase, sentence or whatever you wish inside a set of parentheses. Follow the closed parentheses with the link inside of square brackets, and markdown will create your link.

After the link has been finished, placing a word or phrase inside of quotation marks will cause the word or phrase to appear when a user mouses over the link.
