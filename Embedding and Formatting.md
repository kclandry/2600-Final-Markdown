# Embedding and Formatting

This page will demonstrate more advanced uses of markdown. Namely, embedding images, using links, creating tables and more.

First of all, on the previous page, there were several horizontal lines used to seperate the individual sections. These were created using groupings of certain symbols. A group of three or more asterisks, dashes(hyphens) , or underscores may be used.

```To demonstrate:
---
*****
___________
```
These become the following lines:

---
*****
___________

In the same vein, throughout this tutorial, I have been demonstrating the use of markdown in plain text, then showing the result of using the text in markdown. This is achieved by framing the section with three tick marks (\`\) This creates a section of code. While this is meant to be used for showing the raw code of programming languages, it works just as well for this tutorial.

***When framed with three tick marks, this sentence will be displayed in plain text.***
