#Markdown Basics: Text Formatting
#### This page will cover the basics of simple text formatting. It will include making text italicized, bold and more.

The first step to creating markdown in github is to ensure when you are creating a new file, to use the file extension ".md". This tells github that you are making a markdown file. Forgetting to do this will make the file appear as raw text. If you are having this issue, be sure that your file is called "file.md" and not just "file". 

Formatting text in markdown is both simple and modular. You can affect **single** words, **multiple words** or whole paragraphs. Every type of formatting has a symbol or symbols that you use to denote its use. You will type the symbol when you want to start the formatting, then again when it is done.

Italics are denoted by a single asterisk or a single underscore. * or _

Bold is denoted with a double asterisk or double underscore. ** or __

Three underscores or asterisks combines the two, creating bolded italics. *** or ___

To create striketrhough text, frame your words with two tildes. ~~
