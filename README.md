# Markdown: The Basics and Beyond
### By Kellen Landry

This final project serves as a furthering of both my understanding, and as a tool for those wishing to use the markdown language. Markdown is a simple but very versatile language, used in a wide variety of places and ways. Outside of more "professional" uses such as with Github and other git serverices, markdown is used by other programs as well, such as the popular social program [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). While the tutorial provided in this class did an excellent job in teaching the basics of markdown, this project aims to go deeper. 

The target of this is people who are 'computer literate' and have limited or no knowledge of markdown. I aim to cover the basics in an easily digestible form, and then detail further, more advanced concepts.
